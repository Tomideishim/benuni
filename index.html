    <li>Four arms</li>
    <img src="images/Four arms.png" alt="Four arms">
    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Description: Four Arms is described as a red humanoid alien that is approximately 12 feet tall. 
       He has well developed muscles, two pairs of four-fingered arms, has tough looking red skin, a 
       black stripe that goes from his chin to his lower lip, and he has four yellow eyes: a main pair 
       above and a smaller pair below them. He is from the Planet Khoros .Four Arms wears a white T-shirt with a black line going down
       it, black colored pants, and fingerless gloves. He also doesn’t have any hair (just so you know). 
       The Omnitrix symbol is located on his upper left shoulder. When he was used by Ben 10,000 in an 
       alternate dimension, Four Arms appeared to have a better developed forehead, more developed muscle
       mass, a very different T-shirt design, and a pair of jutting incisors. Plus the Omnitrix symbol was
       located on his chest instead of his left shoulder.</p>
            
       <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Abilities:The first ability of Four Arms is his enhanced strength! With this ability he can be able 
        to lift things that are several times his very own weight and he can punch through any various resilient 
        materials with ease. For example Four Arms can lift anything that’s as heavy as a weapon, from big rocks, 
        which he can throw several feet away, to beams and pillars, which he can use as clubs. His strength can allow 
        him to expand his jaws to bite metal or even damage it. His other three abilities show that he has pretty good
        enhanced reflexes, enhanced speed, and agility. The fourth ability that Four Arms uses is his sonic clap shock
        wave ability. The way that Four Arms demonstrates this ability is by creating powerful strong shock waves can 
        be demonstrated by clapping all four of his hands together or by slamming all four of his fists on the ground 
        pretty hard. Four Arms third ability is his enhanced jumping ability. This kind of ability can allow him to 
        jump at least several times his own height, which is seven stories up in a single bound to be exact. Four 
        Arms fourth ability is the high durability he has. This ability makes him almost fire proof, laser-proof, 
        and being able to survive a fall if he fell from something that is pretty high above the ground.</p>
    <li>Heatblast</li>
    <img src="images/Heatblast.png" alt="Heatblast">
    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">Description: Heatblast can be described as a magma-based life form whose body is composed of a 
       bright inner magma is covered by dark red or brown lava rocks.His home planet is Pyros .Since he is a fire-based entity, Heatblast’s entire
       body can radiate high amounts of heat which means that you have better be careful of that. His feet can be described
       as a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe. 4 year old Heatblast does look the same as the older
       Heatblast except he has a much thinner body, an oversized head, and a much higher pitched voice. Also the Omnitrix symbole
       is loacted on his chest.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">Heatblasts first ability is that he can be able to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form 
       fire into any shape that he chooses. His second ability shows that he can enhance the fire in his hands for flaming punches.
       Heatblast third ability shows that he can breathe fire. Heatblast’s fourth ability showed that with his fire can become hot 
       enough that it could melt a tank in Viktor: The “Spoils”, and melt a road, almost burying Vilgax in boiling tar in Secrets,
       and once even burying Vilgax in the ground up to his shoulders in Secrets. Heatblast’s fifth ability was shown in the episode
       Don’t Drink the Water. In that episode it is shown that when 4-year-old Heatblast gets a temper tantrum, his firepower is magnified
       to the point where its called “supernova-hot” and this kind heat was so extreme that is able to flash vaporized the Fountain of Youth
       water for example, plus a large portion of a cave. Heatblast’s sixth ability is that he can also make his flames very explosive, which
       explains why his fire is tended to blow things up on a regular basis. Heatblast’s seventh ability shows that he can even manipulate his
       fire to create a fire board on which he can use to ride at high speeds by launching fire backwards like an engine or a rocket. On this 
       fire board that he creates, Heatblast has enough skill to ride in a continuous circle, as shown in the episode “Monster Weather”. He can
       even use the fire to jet propel himself like a rocket. Heatblast’s eighth ability is shown that he’s fireproof, as well as heat resistant
       and being invulnerable to magma. Interestingly, it is shown that he is also cold resistant and ice proof. Heatblast’s ninth shows that he’s
       capable of using an ability called terrakinesis. With this he can channeling fire through the ground and the result of this capability is 
       the ability to surf through the air on a board made out of rock. Heatblast’s other abilities are enhanced strength and durability. This 
       enhanced strength is helpful enough to help him hold his own with his fists against Viktor which made the latter 
       stumble several steps backwards. The durability was shown in the episode The Beginning of the End when Heatblast 
       went through the rock ceiling of a cave and he came out with fine with no damage. Heatblast can even swim 
       underwater and use his powers underwater, but he can only use them at a very low intensity.</p>   
    <li>Ripjaws</li>
    <img src="images/Ripjaws.jpg" alt="Ripjaws">
    <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Description: Ripjaws can be described as a walking grey colored fish-like alien that is shown to share some traits with some of the aquatic
       animals we have on earth. These traits that he shares with are alligators, eels, angler fish (the Phosphorescent light located on his head),
       and sharks. You might even be astonished to know that Ripjaws has feet that look very similar to Four Arm’s feet. His eyes are a kind of 
       grayish color. When he talks he speaks in a deep gasping voice. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his upper left torso. </p>
       
    <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Abilities: Ripjaws first ability that he has is breathing underwater (just like any fish), swimming very fast at high speeds, changing between
       a fish tail or legs at will, and using a phosphorescent light on his head which he can use to help him see in very dark areas (like an angler
       fish does). Since you know that Ripjaws can turn his legs into a tail, this display of distinctive feature gives him a merman-like appearance.
       When Ripjaws is outside his water environment when on land, he’s shown to display a loincloth with a very similar pattern to his tail (implying
       that when the loincloth wraps around his legs the loincloth and legs fuse to become the tail). Even though Ripjaws can breathe underwater like 
       any kind of fish, as well as swimming very fast, his fifth ability shows that he’s known to withstand very strong water pressure with great 
       endurance. This implies that Ripjaws possesses the nature of abyssal aquatic life, hence his blank eyes and the anglerfish light in his 
       forehead, which can serve as a light in dark areas. His sixth and seventh abilities show that he’s even highly agile and dexterous. His 
       eighth ability is his expendable steel-bending jaws which are large enough to hold any supply of objects like the Krakken’s two eggs for
       example as seen in the episodes The Krakken and Gone Fishin’. His ninth and tenth abilities are his claws and sharp teeth, which can be 
       used to shred and even, damage metal. Ripjaws final ability is his enhanced strength, with means that like Four Arms, he can lift any 
       objects that weigh more than his own weight. He did also used his enhanced strenght to punch a hole in a dock in the episode Last Laugh.</p>
    <li>Wildmutt</li>
    <img src="images/wildmutt.png" alt="Wildmutt">
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">Description: Wildmutt can be described as a huge, orange dog but he has no eyes, ears, or tail. His posture movements
       are also somewhat apelike. The teeth are very defined and stick out of his mouth so that you can take a good look at them. Though Wildmutt
       has no eyes, he instead using his sense of smell and hearing, which are aided by three gill-like nostrils that are located on each side of
       his neck. The Omnitrix symbol is located on a brace on his left shoulder. Also Four-year-old Wildmutt looks very similar to his ten year 
       old self, but a lot smaller and thinner.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">Abilities: Although we all know that Wildmutt does not have any eyes, one of the abilities that he uses better than eyes is his sense of 
       smell and hearing. Three gill-like nostrils that can be located on each side of his neck aid Wildmutt’s sense of smell ability. Wildmutt’s smelling ability is superb because when he is starts sniffing his “vision” is made up of a dull 3D mapping of where each of these scents originate and like a regular dog he can basically track anything by their scent, regardless if they’re miles away from him. His second ability is enhanced hearing. With this ability Wildmutt’s senses can take the form of either radar or sonar, allowing him to still perceive his environment more clearly. His third ability, enhanced speed and reaction time, allow him to dodge, evade, and counterattack effortlessly with the help of his senses. Wildmutt’s fourth and fifth special abilities are enhanced strength and his teeth, which he can use both to rip off the roof of a car with ease. His fifth special ability is his enhanced agility, which allows him to run, jump, as well as climb at a superhuman rate, which makes him highly acrobatic and gymnastic. Those movements can appear to be very similar to that of an ape. His sharp claws are his sixth ability. With these claws Wildmutt can dig deep craters at a fast pace so make sure to watch out flying dirt and things. His claws can also cut through anything like ropes, nets, etc. Plus watch out when he’s using his claws because they’re sharp. Wildmutt’s final ability is that he’s shown to be a quadruped, but even though he’s capable of standing on his hind legs and can punch, it’s a bit awkward when he stands up to punch a bad guy in the face or stomach.</p>
    <li>Greymatter</li>
    <img src="images/greymatter.jpg" alt="Greymatter">
    <p style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Description: Grey Matter can be described as a grey-skinned, frog-like, bipedal alien, that’s only four inches tall with large green eyes with little minus sign shaped pupils. From the same planet as Azmuth Planet Galvan Prime .When he’s used he wears a white jumpsuit with a black stripe going down it and has a black stripe running down between his eyes. His voice, when he talks, is high-pitched. The Omnitrix symbol located on his back.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Abilities:One on the abilities of Grey Matter is it that despite his small size he belies a great calculative and technical intellect. An example about his intellect is that he can create complicated machines from spare parts and is able understanding the function of any device at a glance. Grey Matter’s intellect brain can also be served as a problem solver and analytical help in any difficult situation. He can manipulate living things by stimulating certain parts of their nervous system, if such beings can be controlled by any external stimuli. The second ability is his size. One of the advantages of his size is allowing him to squeeze into small spaces, he’s good at climbing walls thanks to the tiny suction cups on his skin, his teeth are sharp (so be very careful), and his slimy skin makes him very difficult to grab like the way a slimy fish can. The third ability shows that Gray Matter appears to be stronger than he looks because in the TV show, it’s showed that he was strong enough to move a cleaner’s bucket with mops in it in the episode Ultimate Weapon. In So Long, and Thanks for All the Smoothies, he used his strength to break a coolant pipe to freeze the Vreedle Brothers. If you want to know why Grey Matter can breath underwater is because it’s shown that he is amphibious like a frog and has gills just like a fish. Grey Matter’s fourth ability is that he has a long sticky prehensile like a frog (which owing to his insectivore nature). Grey Matter’s fifth ability is his pre-brain because like all other Galvan’s of his species Galvan’s have a secondary brain that handles basic bodily functions. His final ability is being able to understand any kind of language like understanding Pyxi’s language to be exact in the episode Rad.</p>
    <li>Stinkfly</li>
    <img src="images/sstinkfly.jpg" alt="Stinkfly">
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Description: Stinkfly can be described as a bug-like alien creature with a bug/insect body, 4 insect-like flat legs with 2 arms, human-style hands with a black coloration which are similar to finger less gloves, and 3 claw-like fingers. Stinkfly has 4 pedunculated eyes that are small with a yellowish-orange color. These pedunculated eyes are linked directly to the sides of his huge black head. He has very fragile light green wings with lines on them and his insect limbs are a brown-greenish color. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his forehead between his eyes. When Stinkfly was used by Ben 10,000 from an alternate dimension, his body style did almost look the same as the body style in the original series, except that his eyes where longer with black colored pupils, the stinger and legs where larger, and the clothes where inverted, similar to Ben 10,000’s. Also the Omnitrix symbol is located on his forehead (between his eyes).</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Abilities: Stinkfly’s ability comes from the four instectoid wings he possesses. These wings allow him to be very quick and agile. His wings even help him with changing directions at an exceptional pace. Stinkfly’s second ability is that he can shoot green slime out of his mouth and eyes from the pollen ducts in a vast range of forms. These forms of his slime can be a flammable toxin that can blow up things (demonstrated by Kevin 11) and an immobilizing jelly which is very useful for capturing enemies and being able to use to swing anywhere like Spiderman can. Plus it serves as a good fire extinguisher. Like Eye Guy, Stinkfly is shown to have 360° Vision. He is even able to move two eyes at the back of his head and keep the other two eyes at the front of his head. Stinkfly third ability is poisonous gas, which was demonstrated in the episode, Don’t Drink the Water. When he was battling giant monstrous plants that were magically created by Hex the Magician, 4-year-old Stinkfly was able to emit a very powerful flatulation of his strange poisonous gas which was strong enough to whither them. Plus you have to be very careful because the gas he emits is very dangerous. Even though it’s shown that 4-year-old Stinkfly can emit this poisonous gas its actually unknown if the older Stinkfly has this kind of capability. Stinkfly’s fourth ability is enhanced strength. With this ability he uses he can carry heavy loads while he is maintaining a very steady flight. It also turned out that Stinkfly could even still fly while Vilgax was hanging on his tail, barely being weighed down by Vilgax’s immense size and weight. Stinkfly’s fifth ability is enhanced durability. His enhanced durability comes from his exoskeleton body because as it turns out its fairly strong, allowing him to survive unscathed while being smashed through buildings and being caught inside a large explosion. Stinkfly’s final ability is his sharp blade-like tail, which is known to slice through steel with little effort. </p>
    <li>XlR8</li>
    <img src="images/xlr8.png" alt="XLR8">
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Description: XLR8’s description is shown that he resembles a semi-armored velociraptor.He is from planet Kinet. He has black balls on his feet and wears a helmet with a visor, which leave the other features about his head unknown. Whenever his visor does come up, you can see that he has a blue face, green eyes, black lips, and stripes. On his tail there are 5 blue stripes. The visor that he wears on his head has a built in X-ray vision ability that allows him to see through any object or person. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his chest. When used by Ben 10,000 in an alternate dimension, his legs and tail where a white color instead of the blue color used XLR8. He only has three stripes on his tail, his clothing has longer sleeves with a pair of stripes under his shoulders, and he has an arrow shaped symbol located on the lower torso. The Omnitrix symbol of the 30-year-old XLR8 is located on his chest. </p>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Abilities: One of XLR8’s abilities is his enhanced speed. With this enhanced speed XLR8 can manipulate friction that can reach speeds of 500 mph within two seconds! It’s even revealed that in the episode The Unnaturals, XLR8 can move so quickly that somehow time appears to stand completely stand still. His enhanced speed to is even used to deliver attacks with a lot of rapid succession, such as excessively kicking or stabbing enemies. His third ability shows that XLR8 even use his speed ability to create creating a tornado (like Sonic and The Flash) that is capable of generating a centripetal vacuum powerful enough to lift small enemies or even giant ones like one of the mutated To’kustars off the ground. He does this by either running in a circular pattern or spinning at supersonic speeds. It is revealed that in the episode Store 23, XLR8 fourth ability shows that he has dexterity with being able think of a million combinations to which can be any possible codes on a padlock or a bomb in virtually seconds just like the Flash does from Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. XLR8’s fifth ability is enhanced reflexes. This ability allows him to dodge any kind attack with a little effort. His sixth ability is scissor-like clawed hands. He can use these to cut through any material like evil alien like plants for example. His seventh ability is that his speed can make him even run on walls and on water just like Dash from the The Incredibles movie can. In the episode The Krakken, XLR8 showed his eighth ability which is enhanced strength which he used to carry a multitude of enough fishermen and Gwen safely back to the shore of a lake with out even slowing down, even as well as greatly damaging an enemy like Exo-Skull with physical attacks for example, which are further enhanced by striking him at rapid succession. XLR8 also has two other abilities enhanced jumping (when he’s running at very a fast pace) and enhanced recovery. The recovery ability helps XLR8 recover from any injury faster than any other species. His eleventh ability is his X-Ray vision helmet that allows him to see though anything like Superman can. In the episode Back with a Vengeance, when Kevin 11 was pushed and almost fell off a cart, he used his XLR8 tail to hang on to the wire, revealing that XLR8’s tail is a prehensile tail just like a monkey’s tail. The ability was also used in the episode Ken 10, when Ben 10,000 as XLR8 used his tail showing a nullvoid egg. In the episode Monster Weather, XLR8’s final ability is being able to cling on to any surface, using either his clawed hands or agility, or being able to use both as a combination.</p>
    <li>Ghostfreak</li>
    <img src="images/ghostfreak.jpg" alt="ghostfreak">
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">Description: Ghostfreak can be described as a phantom/ghost-like alien, with claw-like hands and one purple colored movable eye. He has grey skin with black lines that run all over him and this skin that he wears is actually removable, which will reveal his tentacles or his true form which can be very scary so try not to be frightened. He can even deform his own shape to appear like wisps of grey, which can somewhat, look like a transparent flame. When he talks, he speaks in a faint, whispering voice. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his chest (peeking through his skin). </p>
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">Abilities: Ghostfreak’s abilities are actually composed by several aspects from our traditional ghosts of the myths and lore’s. Like for example his first two abilities is hovering like a ghost and being able to phase through any solid matter, which as we all know is his intangibility power. That kind of ability is a very successful and powerful defense if any enemies every try to attack him as well as using it for a means of infiltrating high-security locations. Ghostfreak even shows that his intangibility is even capable of making other objects or maybe even people intangible and transparent through physical contact. It also appears that he can even phase parts of himself through people to cause them pain or maybe even shock them into submission, with it also being shown that he can make people feel deathly cold (or it would feel like sending a chill down your spin) by just moving right through them like a regular ghost. The thing is that when Ghostfreak becomes invisible that means you can’t actually see him. Ghostfreak’s third ability is body possession, which means that he can posses the bodies of any of his enemies and control their movements. For example possessing somebody Ghostfreak can cause them to fly like him, allowing him to freely slam them against walls, floors, or even hit them. Ghostfreak can even access the abilities of other beings that possess superpowers and ones who don’t have any powers. Like for example in the case of going up against the evil mana draining supervillian Darkstar, when Ghostfreak possessed him he was able to gain access to his powers and movements. Before Ghostfreak possessed Darkstar, Darkstar tried to absorb the Mana (life energy) from him but it didn’t work because since Mana is life energy Ghostfreak’s species don’t have life energy in them since they are not alive like most life forms are. Ghostfreak fourth ability is using telekinetic abilities as seen in the episode Ghost Town. These telekinetic abilities are known as energy beams of either blue or purple energy (maybe even green energy), but the one problem for Ghostfreak is that these abilities can only be used if he’s only in his true form. His fifth ability comes from the tentacles that hid under his protective skin. These tentacles can be used as a means of scaring enemies into submission, using them to catch objects, and even using them to grab objects (like for example a bus full of people). Also these tentacles even appear to be resistant to sunlight. Other abilities that Ghostfreak has are enhanced strength, being able to survive in space, sharp teeth (that can only be used when he’s in his true form), sharp clawed fingers, and his movable eye which is shown to move down to his shoulder and to his back which is kind of creepy but a bit cool. He can even rotate his skull as well (only in his true form).</p>
    <li>Upgrade</li>
    <img src="images/Upgrade.png" alt="upgrade">
    <p>Description: Upgrade can be described as a technological organic humanoid who wears white clothing on his front torso, a black exterior on his back with green stripes that is shown to resemble a circuitry of computer chips all over him, and has a green circled eye that glows when he is speaking (this was shown in the Original Series). He is from planet Galvan B (Originally a moon) .The Omnitrix symbol is located on his chest. </p>
    <p>Abilities: The thing about Upgrade is that one of his abilities shows that he isn’t really solid due to the fact that he can be both liquid and gelatinous. Due to that he shows that he’s capable of reshaping and regenerating himself in order to let any projectiles or blows pass through him. The way he does that is by creating a hole in his body at will. His second ability is something called internal nanotechnology. This kind of ability allows him to merge with or control any type technology within his reach just by spreading over it. The size of any device that he merges with is actually inconsequential because he can control it as naturally as he would his own body. Once he is merged with the technology he improves the technology, making the technology he possesses far more advanced and futuristic and causing new features to form on it hence why he is named Upgrade. Sometimes Upgrade can tamper with technology once he merges it like finding ways to shut it down or disassembling it piece by piece. In the episode Road Trip Rumble from the Original Series, it’s shown that Upgrade has an ability to reconfigure technology to a suit for any kind of situation, like for example transform the Rust Bucket into a giant battle armored robot with a heavy arsenal of plasma weapons and retractable robotic manipulator arms. He did the same thing to Kevin’s car in the episode OTTO Motives. When Upgrade possesses technology it allows him to transform it with seemingly no limit, such as for example merging with a baseball-launching machine, turning it into a tripod-like robot that fired a seemingly infinite amount of baseballs. When at the moment he un-merged with it, the machine he has merged with is returned too normal. Also he can make his head or his face appear anywhere on the machines he possesses. Occasionally it’s shown he can even merge with organic life, as long as there’s technology integrated within them, which is shown with Rojo and Rex as examples. He can even merge with beings that are mechanical in nature like a Chronosapien (Clockwork’s species) for example. In the episode Something Zombozo This Way Comes, Upgrade even displayed an ability of upgrading Rook’s Proto-Tool just by touching it! The third ability that Upgrade displayed was his eye because when he was battling some Megawatts he found out that he can launch a powerful green plasma blast from his eye. As shown in the episode Side Effects, Upgrade’s fourth ability shows that he can form energy constructs such as an energy spike, though mostly while merged with machinery and upgrading them into weapons. Upgrade’s fifth ability is having the capability to travel through electrical currents like the way the Megawatts do, as shown in the episode Midnight Madness. He can even phase through most any metal or technology. If he is falling from something high up his sixth ability shows that he can stretch his body like a parachute to gently descend through the air, which was demonstrated in the episode Secrets. Upgrade’s seventh ability shows that since he’s inorganic, he has the ability to survive in a vacuum of space. Upgrade’s final three abilities show can even shape shift, stretch out pretty far which is cool, and he is shown to have super strength to life heavy objects. His enhanced strength was shown in the episode Be Afraid of the Dark, when he is trying to overpower Dr. Viktor in space.</p>
    <li>Diamondhead</li>
    <img src="images/diamondhead.jpg" alt="diamondhead">
    <p>Description: Diamondhead can be described as a silicon-based life form, whose body is composed of extremely thick green organic crystals. He is from planet Petropia .He sprouts four long and short green crystal shards on his back and has a sharp head. Mental note if he tried to give you a hug you have better be careful of those shards. In the Original Series of Ben 10, Diamondhead wears a uniform that is half black on the right and half white on the left. On the left there is a black patch on his shoulder where the Omnitrix symbol is located. When used by Ben 10,000 from an alternate dimension, the shards on Diamondhead’s back where a lot bigger than usual, the lower ones disappeared, and he wears a black colored sleeveless shirt, with white pants and boots. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his chest.</p>
    <p>Abilities: The thing about Diamondhead is that since his body composed of extremely thick organic green crystals, his first ability shows that he’s able to manipulating the atomic structure of his physiology at will. This allows him to form his limbs into diamond weapons like blades and bludgeons for example. He is capable at controlling all crystals he generates and can firing them sequentially out of his hands, as it was revealed in the Cartoon Network online game “Ben To The Rescue“. Diamondhead’s second ability is creating powerful attacks with his shards. For example, he can expel his diamond shards in all directions. He can even shoot shards when training or going against enemies. He can age the shards so that they explode upon impact as shown when Ben used him to battle Vilgax. Diamondhead can even explode his body parts into crystalline formations, as shown in the episode, And Then There Were 10. He can even cause crystal constructs to grow from his body, the latter of which he protected Gwen from an energy blast with his body which caused large crystalline spikes to appear on his back and then disappear. His third special ability is that he can make monstrous clusters of crystals, conjuring walls and forming crystal shields and ramps as a way of defending himself and traveling at high speeds. He is shown to reshape his projectiles into limited shapes and can even form gaping crystal-like hands, which can be useful when trying to capture enemies. He can even use his crystals to freeze enemies in place by either touching them or growing them when punching his fist in the ground. Diamondhead’s fourth ability is energy absorption because his body resembles a living prism, allowing weapons similar to lasers to be refracted and rendered useless against him. He’s even immune to fire attacks as well as see in the episode Framed. His fifth ability is crystalkinesis. Crystalkinesis means that he can make diamonds come out of the ground to protect himself, use them as an elevator to go up, and he using them trap his enemies if they try to escape. Also every time he moves he makes a crystal metallic sound. Diamondhead’s sixth ability shows that he has superhuman strength, which he easily used to overpower Vilgax (Ben’s biggest enemy) in a one-on-one brawl. Diamondhead’s seventh ability is age immunity because since he’s made out of organic crystals, he’s immune to aging and time rays because as we all know crystals and diamonds don’t particularly age. His eighth ability is durability because Diamondhead showed that he’s extremely durable to physical impacts as for example when withstanding a punch from Vilgax (wearing a Malware mechamorph armor suit). Diamondhead’s eighth ability shows that he can survive in a vacuum of space. His ninth ability shows that he can extend his arms as shown in the episode Blukic and Driba go to Area 51 and the episode, It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad Ben World out there. His tenth ability shows that he was skilled enough to levitate crystal prisms, as shown in the episode Vengeance of Vilgax: Part 2. Diamondhead’s final ability is regeneration because if he gets cracked he can be able to regenerate himself, but there is a limited extent to the regenerating process.</p>
